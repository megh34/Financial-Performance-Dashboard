##  Problem Statement
The organization faced challenges in:
- Tracking overall sales and profitability across different countries and products.
- Understanding how discount strategies affected revenue and profit.
- Monitoring month-by-month financial performance trends.
- Identifying high-performing and underperforming products at a glance.

Without a centralized, interactive dashboard, decision-making was slow and based on fragmented reports.
