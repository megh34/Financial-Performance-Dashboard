##  Insights Can Derive

###  **Product Performance**

* **Top-Selling Product**: **Paseo** with `$33.01M` in sales.
* **Bottom Performer**: **Carretera** with `$13.82M`.
* A clear revenue gap between the top and bottom products, suggesting product prioritization strategies.

---

###  **Monthly Sales Trends**

* Peak in **October**.
* Consistent rise from **May to October**, followed by a slight dip in **November**.
* Seasonal trend suggests Q3-Q4 focus could maximize sales.

---

###  **Profit by Discount Band**

* **Medium Discount Band** generated the highest profit: `$6.19M` (\~39.2%).
* **Low Discount Band**: `$4.63M` (\~27.7%).
* **High Discount Band**: `$5.88M` (\~33%).
* Medium discounts are the sweet spot â€” high enough to incentivize buyers, low enough to retain margins.

---

###  **Country-Wise Insights**

* **United States** is the highest contributor to both sales and profit (\~\$25M in profit).
* Other top countries: **Canada**, **France**, **Germany**.
* Focus on high-performing regions like the US for expansion or targeted marketing.

---

###  **Segment-Wise Revenue**

* **Government** and **Small Business** segments lead in total revenue.
* **Enterprises** are moderate contributors.
* **Channel Partners** have the least contribution â€” may need evaluation or repositioning.

---

###  Actionable Insights

* Optimize pricing and discounts â€” medium levels give the best profit margin.
* Focus marketing efforts during peak months (Septâ€“Oct).
* Reassess low-performing products and segments for improvement or elimination.
* Scale operations in top regions like the US and high-performing segments like Small Business.
