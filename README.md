#  Financial Performance Dashboard

##  Introduction
This dashboard provides a detailed financial overview of a company's performance across multiple key indicators. Built with the goal of helping stakeholders understand sales trends, profit margins, and the impact of discounts, it visually summarizes large volumes of data into simple and actionable insights.

---

##  Problem Statement
The organization faced challenges in:
- Tracking overall sales and profitability across different countries and products.
- Understanding how discount strategies affected revenue and profit.
- Monitoring month-by-month financial performance trends.
- Identifying high-performing and underperforming products at a glance.

Without a centralized, interactive dashboard, decision-making was slow and based on fragmented reports.

##  Methodology / Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Collected and cleaned financial data (Sales, Profit, Cost of Goods Sold, Discounts).
   - Categorized products, countries, discount bands, and months.

2. **Dashboard Design**:  
   - Created KPI cards for **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Total COGS**, and **Total Discounts**.
   - Built trend lines to track monthly **Sales** and **Profit** performance.
   - Analyzed **Product-wise Sales and Profit** using stacked bar charts.
   - Visualized **Sales and Profit by Country** to uncover geographic insights.
   - Examined **Impact of Discount Bands** on profitability and units sold.
   - Added interactive filters (e.g., year selection) for user flexibility.

3. **Visualization Tools Used**:  
   - Bar charts, line charts, KPI tiles, color gradients for easy interpretation.
   - Tableau/Power BI with dynamic and responsive design principles.

##  Results / Conclusion

- **United States and Canada** contributed the highest sales volumes among countries analyzed.
- The **Paseo** product was the top performer, both in sales and profit.
- **Low discount bands** maintained better profitability compared to high discount scenarios.
- There was a **sharp increase in sales and profit** during the last quarter (months 10-12).

By using this dashboard, the company can better align its discount policies, optimize its product portfolio, and focus on high-performing regions and products for future growth.
